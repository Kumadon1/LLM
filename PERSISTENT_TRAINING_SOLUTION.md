# Persistent Training Data Solution

## Problem Summary
The training data was not persisting across sessions. The neural model was incorrectly trying to train on Markov n-grams instead of the actual text corpus, and training data was not being accumulated in the database.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Training Service (`backend/services/training_service.py`)
Created a comprehensive training service that:

- **Persists Training Text**: Saves all training text to the `text_corpus` table in the database
- **Accumulates Data**: Loads all historical training data for each new training session
- **Proper Dataset**: `PersistentTextDataset` class that loads from the corpus table, not Markov n-grams
- **Improved Model Architecture**: Better neural network with CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms
- **Checkpoint Management**: Saves and loads model checkpoints for continuous learning
- **Training Statistics**: Provides comprehensive statistics about training data and models

#### Key Functions:
```python
# Persist new training text to database
persist_training_text(text, title, source) -> corpus_id

# Train with full persistence and accumulation
train_with_persistence(text, block_size, epochs, batch_size, learning_rate, progress_callback) -> (checkpoint_path, stats)

# Get comprehensive training statistics
get_training_statistics() -> dict
```

### 2. Updated Job Runner (`backend/services/job_runner.py`)
Modified to use the new persistent training service:
- Replaced direct calls to `process_text` and `train` with `train_with_persistence`
- Proper progress reporting throughout the entire training pipeline
- Returns checkpoint path and training statistics

### 3. Fixed Neural Service (`backend/services/neural_service.py`)
Corrected the `CharDBDataset` to:
- Load from `text_corpus` table instead of `markov_ngrams`
- Properly clean and process text data
- Sort by creation date to get most recent training data

### 4. Enhanced Database Architecture
Using the enhanced database system with:
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Proper object-relational mapping
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **Migration System**: Schema versioning and evolution

### 5. API Endpoints
Added new endpoint for training statistics:
```
GET /api/training/stats
```
Returns comprehensive statistics including:
- Corpus information (total texts, words, characters)
- Checkpoint information (total, best, recent)
- Training metrics and accuracy

## How It Works Now

### Training Flow:
1. **User submits text** through the API
2. **Text is persisted** to the `text_corpus` table
3. **Markov n-grams** are extracted and stored (for the Markov model)
4. **Neural model dataset** loads ALL text from the corpus (cumulative)
5. **Model trains** on the entire accumulated corpus
6. **Checkpoint is saved** with the trained model weights
7. **Metrics are recorded** for tracking performance

### Data Persistence:
- All training text is permanently stored in the `text_corpus` table
- Each training session adds to the corpus (cumulative)
- Model checkpoints are saved and can be loaded for continued training
- Training metrics are tracked over time

### Key Benefits:
1. **Persistent Storage**: Training data survives application restarts
2. **Cumulative Learning**: Each training session builds on previous data
3. **Proper Architecture**: Neural model trains on actual text, not n-grams
4. **Checkpoint Management**: Models can be saved and restored
5. **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics and metrics

## Usage Example

```python
from backend.services.training_service import train_with_persistence, get_training_statistics

# Train with new text (automatically persists and accumulates)
checkpoint_path, stats = train_with_persistence(
    text="Your training text here...",
    block_size=100_000,
    epochs=5,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    progress_callback=lambda pct, msg: print(f"{pct}%: {msg}")
)

# Get training statistics
stats = get_training_statistics()
print(f"Total corpus texts: {stats['corpus']['total_texts']}")
print(f"Total words: {stats['corpus']['total_words']}")
print(f"Best model loss: {stats['checkpoints']['best']['loss']}")
```

## Database Schema

### text_corpus Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `title`: Optional title for the text
- `content`: The actual training text
- `source`: Source identifier
- `metadata`: JSON metadata
- `word_count`: Number of words
- `char_count`: Number of characters
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### neural_checkpoints Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `block_size`: Training block size
- `path`: File path to saved model
- `loss`: Training loss value
- `accuracy`: Model accuracy
- `is_best`: Flag for best model
- `notes`: Training notes
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:
1. Submit training text via `/api/train` endpoint
2. Monitor progress via `/api/train/{job_id}`
3. View training statistics via `/api/training/stats`
4. See accumulated corpus information
5. Track model performance over time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental Training**: Train only on new data while preserving old knowledge
2. **Data Versioning**: Track different versions of the corpus
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare performance across different checkpoints
4. **Automated Retraining**: Retrain when corpus reaches certain size
5. **Data Validation**: Ensure quality of training data before persisting
